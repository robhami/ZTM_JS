# ZeroToMastery- Cmd Line

How humans communicated with computers before GUI existed. 

Tend to be faster than GUI's. 

Can access servers, databases, front-end application and it can download scripts others have written from.

Installed Git to allow it to run on Windows.

Quick Note: For Windows Users
In the next video, please ignore the text at the bottom. Instead, you will find all of the equivalent Windows commands below. The text at the bottom of the next lecture is for another option for Windows users which is Command Prompt which I do not recommend for this course (I left the text in the video for reference only):
Windows ONLY: How to open -a “Sublime Text”  in windows?

**Assuming your Sublime Text 3 was located in the "C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3" directory**
